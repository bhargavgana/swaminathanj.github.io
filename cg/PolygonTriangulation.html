<h2>Polygon Triangulation</h2>

<p><b style="color: blue">Problem definition</b>:  Let P be a polygon over a set of n points p1, p2, ..., pn 
in 2D plane. We say that P is a triangulated polygon if points are connected by line segments such that 
the interior space of the polygon are divided into non-intersecting triangular regions.</p>
<p>Given below is a polygon and its various triangulations. The last one is not a triangulation since the
non-intersecting region property is violated.</p>
<ul><img src="images/eg-triangulations.png" width="600"></ul></p>

<h4>Special case: Triangulating a convex polygon</h4>
<p>A (simple) convex polygon can be triangulated in a straightforward manner by picking an arbitrary
vertex and drawing line segments (or diagonals) from that vertex to every other vertex that are not 
its neighbors. This is possible because from any vertex all other vertices are visible through the
interior of the polygon. Starting from a vertex one can traverse in a clockwise or counter-clockwise 
direction and draw the n-3 diagonals as the vertices are succesively visited. It is easy to infer
that the algorithm takes linear time.</p>

<p>The first traingulation in the above figure is an example of this method.</p>

<h3>Triangulating a simple (not necessarily convex) polygon</h3>
<p>In computational geometry literature, there are several algorithms to triangulate a simple polygon. 
(i) O(n<sup>2</sup>) Fisk's Ear Clipping algorithm, (ii) O(nlogn) algorithm to decompose the simple 
polygon into monotone polygons and then triangulating them, (iii) O(n) Chazelle's algorithm. There are 
several other variations too. We will discuss the first two. The third one, although efficient, is too 
complex to implement.</p>

<h3>Triangulation using Ear clipping method</h3>

<p><b style="color: blue">Definition</b>: Let P be a polygon in 2D space. Let v be a vertex in P and let
v' and v" be its neighbors. We say v'-v-v" is an <b style="color: blue">ear</b> if the line segment
v'-v" lies entirely in the interior of the polygon. In such a case, the vertex v is referred to as an
ear tip.</p>

<p>Every simple polygon has at least two ears. By identifying the ears and repeatedly clipping them,
a polygon can be triangulated.</p>

<p>Clipping an ear involves removing the vertex v along with its edges v'-v and v-v" from the polygon 
and adding a line segment v'-v" (also called as diagonal) to the polygon. Removing an ear reduces the 
polygon size by 1 since v is no more part of the polygon. By repeating this n-3 times, a simple polygon 
can be triangulated resulting in n-2 traingles.</p>

<p><b style="color: blue">Question</b>: How do we identify an ear (or ear tip)?</p>

<p><b>In a convex polygon</b> every vertex is an ear tip. So during each iteration, any of the remaining 
vertices can be randomly picked and the ear can be removed.</p> 
<p>The working of the algorithm for an example is shown below. Vertices p1, p4, p7 and p3 were picked
succesively to triangulate the polygon. Clearly several other choices are possible.</p>
<ul><img src="images/fiskconvex.png" width="600"></ul>

<p>An important property of the convex polygon that allows this approach to work is: <u>each vertex in 
a convex polygon is a hull vertex. When an ear is clipped from the polygon, the residual polygon 
remains convex</u>.</p>

<p><b>For a simple polygon that is not convex</b> this property does not hold. Non-hull vertices 
(called as reflex vertices) cannot be an ear tip. However, there is no guarantee that a hull vertex 
can be a ear tip either. Also, a reflex vertex can turn into a hull vertex. Consider the example 
given in the following figure.</p> 
<ol>
  <li>Vertex u cannot be an ear tip. It can be seen that segment u'-u" is not interior to the polygon. 
  This is because the vertex u is not a hull vertex.</li><br>
  <li>Vertex v is a hull vertex and can be an ear tip. It can be seen that the segment v'-v" is 
  completely interior to the polygon.</li><br>
  <li>Vertex w cannot be an ear tip inspite of it being a hull vertex because	a part of the polygon 
  is obstructing the path w'-w" and hence w'-w" does not lie completely inside the polygon.</li>
</ol>
<ul><img src="images/earselection.png" width="250"></ul>

<p>There are two more consequences due to the concavity in the polygon.</p>
<p>1. A hull vertex that satisfies the property of the ear tip, can lose that property as the algorithm 
progresses. For example, consider the polygon below.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Initially, vertices v and v" satisfy the property of ear tip. i.e. the diagonals v'-v" and v-v**
  lie completely interior to the polygon.</li>
  <li>Let's say we chose vertex v as the ear tip during the first iteration and clipped v'-v-v".</li>
  <li>Now, vertex v" loses the property of the ear tip since v'-v** does not lie to the interior of
  the residual polygon.</li>
</ul>
<ul><img src="images/earselection2.png" width="500"></ul>

<p>2. A reflex vertex can become a hull vertex and possibly gain the property of ear tip as the 
algorithm progresses. For example, see the two cases shown in the figure below.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Initially, vertex u is a reflex vertex.</li>
	<li>Let's say we chose vertex v* as the ear tip and remove the ear v'-v*-u.</li>
	<li>In the first case shown at the left, vertex u not only becomes a hull vertex but also acquires 
  the property of ear tip.</li>
  <li>In the second case shown at the right, vertex u becomes a hull vertex but not an ear tip.</li>
</ul>

<ul><table border="1">
  <tr align="center">
    <td>Reflex vertex u turns into convex vertex<br> and also becomes ear tip</td>
    <td>Reflex vertex u turns into convex vertex<br> but not an ear tip</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="center">
    <td><img src="images/earselection3.png" width="300">&emsp; &emsp;</td>
    <td><img src="images/earselection4.png" width="300"></td>
  </tr>
</table></ul>

<p>Let's summarize the points observered.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Not all hull vertices qualify to be an ear tip.</li>
	<li>A hull vertex remains a hull vertex throughout.</li>
	<li>A hull vertex that qualify as an ear tip may not retain the property throughout.</li>
	<li>A reflex vertex can turn into a hull vertex and possibly acquire the property of ear tip.</li>
</ol>

<p>Although the above examples do not give an approach to pick the ear tip, it gives some clue on the 
criteria that a vertex needs to satisfy to be chosen as an ear tip and how often we need to check
the criteria.</p>

<p>To arrive at a general algorithm, let's define three sets of vertices.</p>
<ol>
	<li><b style="color: blue">Set C</b>: Tracks all convex hull vertices at any point of the algorithm.</li>
	<li><b style="color: blue">Set E</b>: Subset of C that tracks vertices that have ear tip property.</li>
	<li><b style="color: blue">Set R</b>: Tracks all reflex vertices as algorithm progresses.</li>
</ol>

<p>The basic idea of the algorithm is given below.</p>

<p><b style="color: blue">Initialization</b>: Firstly, all hull vertices can be computed in O(nlogn) time 
using Graham scan. This needs to be done once in the beginning since a hull vertex remains so throughout.
Thus the convex set C can be determined. Secondly, to determine the reflex set R, all one needs to do is
to compute V - C where V is the set of all vertices. Thirdly, to determine the Ear set E, one can take 
every vertex p in C, compute the ear (triangle) and then check if at least one of the reflex vertices 
lies within the ear. If so, add p to E. This takes O(n<sup>2</sup>) time.</p>

<p><b style="color: blue">Execution</b>: After the above initialization step, n-3 iterations are done.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pick a vertex v from the E and clip the ear v'-v-v". This takes O(1) time.</li>
  <li>Remove v from E and C. This takes O(1) time.</li>
  <li>Check if v' and v" has turned into convex vertices. If so, add it/them to both C. It takes O(1) time.</li> 
  <li>Further, if it/they satisfy the ear tip property, add it/them to E. This step takes O(n) time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, the iterative step takes (n-3)*O(n) = O(n<sup>2</sup>) time. </p>

<p><b>The question that remains is how too check if v' and v" has turned into convex vertices?</b></p>
<p>Let v* and v** be the new adjacent vertices of v' and v" repsectively after ear tip v 
is removed. If the interior angle <u>/ v*-v'-v"</u> &lt; &pi;, then v' has turned into a convex 
vertex. Similarly, if the interior angle <u>/ v'-v"-v**</u> &lt; &pi;, then v" has turned into a 
convex vertex.</p>

<p>The figures below show the step-by-step working of the algorithm for an example. The ear vertices picked
successively during each iteration are as follows: 1, 17, 14, 12, 11, 9, 7, 6, 4, 3, 2, 15, 13. During each
iteration, the sets C, E and R are revised.</p>

<p>The overall complexity is O(nlogn) + O(n) + O(n<sup>2</sup>) + O(n<sup>2</sup>) = O(n<sup>2</sup>).</p>

<h3>Triangulation using monotone polygons</h3>

<p>There are two steps in this approach. Given a polygon P, the first phase is to divide it into
monotone polygons. In the second phase, the monotone polygons are triangulated.</p>

<p><b>What is a monotone polygon?</b></p>
<p>A polygon P is called monotone with respect to a line L, if every line orthogonal to L
intersects P at most twice.</p>

<p>Given below is a monotone polygon and the demonstration of above definition. The thick
blue line denotes the straight line L and the light blue lines perpendicular to l denotes
the orthogonal lines. L and its orthogonals are shown in three positions.</p>

<table border="1">
	<tr align="center">
		<td><img src="images/eg-xymonotone.png" width="165"></td>
		<td><img src="images/eg-xymonotone1.png" width="165"></td>
		<td><img src="images/eg-xymonotone2.png" width="165"></td>
		<td><img src="images/eg-xymonotone3.png" width="165"></td>
	</tr>
</table><br><br>

<p>Note that if L is tilted in certain manner, the orthogonals may pass through the edge of the polygon,
apparently breaking the definition of intersection at max two points. In such cases, we can tilt line L
slightly so that it does not pass through any edge of the polygon.</p>

<p>In practical problems we will be interested in line L being either vertical or horizontal.
Based on this, a polygon may be x-monotone, y-monotone or xy-monotone.</p>

<p>A more useful way to understand monotone polygon is as follows.</p>
<ul>
	<p><b>x-monotone polygon</b>: Assume that from the leftmost point two ants travel along the
	upper and lower paths to the rightmost point. If the x value is always increasing (or non-
	decreasing) as the ants travel along their paths, then it is a x-monotone polygon.</p>
	<p><b>y-monoton polygon</b>: Assume that from the topmost point two ants travel along the
	left and right paths to the bottommost point. If the y-value is always decreasing (or non-
	increasing) as the ants travel along their paths, then it is a y-monotone polygon.</p>
</ul>

<p>Given below are three polygons, the first one is both x- and y-monotone. The second one is
x-monotone but not y-monotone and the third is y-monotone but not x-monotone.</p>

<ul><table>
	<tr>

		<td><img src="images/eg-ymonotone.png" width="200">&emsp;</td>
	</tr>
</table></ul>

<h3>Step 1: Breaking a polygon into x-monotone pieces</h3>

<p>In this approach, we will focus on breaking a polygon into x-monotone pieces. We will do
different cases that can arise one at a time and then come out with the overall algorithm.</p>

<p style="color: blue"><b>Case 1</b>: Handling a split vertex</p>
<p>Consider the polygon below. We call the reflex vertex 4 as split vertex because when seen
from left to right, two edges emerge from 4. And because of the presence of the split vertex, 
this is not a x-monotone polygon.</p>
<ul><img src="images/eg-monotone-b4split.png" width="150"></ul>

<p>There are three ways to split the polygon into x-monotone pieces.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Draw a diagonal from 6 to 4 yielding two x-monotone pieces: 6-4-5 and 1-2-3-4-6.</li>
  <li>Draw a diagonal from 2 to 4 yielding two x-monotone pieces: 1-2-4-5-6 and 2-3-4.</li>
  <li>Draw a diagonal from 1 to 4 yielding two x-monotone pieces: 1-2-3-4 and 1-4-5-6.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the above three cases 6, 2 and 1 are called as opposite vertices respectively.</p>

<ul>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="images/eg-monotone-split1.png" width="150">&emsp;</td>
      <td><img src="images/eg-monotone-split2.png" width="150">&emsp;</td>
      <td><img src="images/eg-monotone-split3.png" width="150">&emsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</ul>

<p>How do we arrive at a general method to determine the opposite vertex (for split vertex)?</p>
<p>We use a vertical sweepline L to determine the opposite vertex of the split vertex.
We keep track of last seen vertex as L sweeps the polygon. The moment the L hits a
split vertex, we connect it to the last seen vertex.

<p><b>Note that the start vertex 1</b> is also a split vertex. However, since it is at
the beginning we don't attempt to draw any diagonals. There can be more than one start 
vertices. See the figure below. Both 1 and 3 are start vertices.</p>
<ul><img src="images/eg-2startvertices.png" width="130"></ul>

<p>This brings us to the question: How do we differentiate between a start and split
vertices?</p>
<p>The interior angle at the start vertex is < &pi; while that of split vertex is > &pi;.<br>
It is easy to infer <u>/ 7-1-2</u> < &pi;, <u>/ 2-3-4</u> < &pi;, <u>/ 4-5-6</u> > &pi;</p>

<p style="color: blue"><b>Case 2</b>: Handling a merge vertex</p>
<p>Consider the polygon below. We call the reflex vertex 1 as merge vertex because when seen
from left to right, two edges merge into 1. And because of the presence of the merge vertex, 
this is not a x-monotone polygon.</p>
<ul><img src="images/eg-monotone-b4merge.png" width="150"></ul>

<p>There are three ways to split the polygon into x-monotone pieces.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Draw a diagonal from 1 to 3 yielding two x-monotone pieces: 1-2-3 and 1-3-4-5-6.</li>
  <li>Draw a diagonal from 1 to 5 yielding two x-monotone pieces: 1-2-3-4-5 and 1-5-6.</li>
  <li>Draw a diagonal from 1 to 4 yielding two x-monotone pieces: 1-2-3-4 and 1-4-5-6.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the above three cases 3, 5 and 4 are called as opposite vertices respectively.</p>

<ul>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="images/eg-monotone-merge1.png" width="150">&emsp;</td>
      <td><img src="images/eg-monotone-merge2.png" width="150">&emsp;</td>
      <td><img src="images/eg-monotone-merge3.png" width="150">&emsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</ul>

<p>How do we arrive at a general method to determine the opposite vertex (for merge vertex)?</p>
<p>We use a vertical sweepline L to determine the opposite vertex of the merge vertex.
As L sweeps the polygon once L hits a merge vertex, we look for the next vertex and 
connect it to the merge vertex. This is demonstrated in the below example.</p>
<ul>
  <table>
    <tr align="center">
      <td>
        L hits vertex 6. <br> Next vertex = null.<br><br>
        <img src="images/merge1.png" width="130">&emsp;
      </td>
      <td>
        L hits vertex 2. <br> Next vertex = null.<br><br>
        <img src="images/merge2.png" width="130">&emsp;
      </td>
      <td>
        L hits vertex 1. <br> Next vertex = null.<br><br>
        <img src="images/merge3.png" width="130">&emsp;
      </td>
      <td>
        L hits vertex 5. <br> Next vertex = 5.<br><br>
        <img src="images/merge4.png" width="130">&emsp;
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</ul>

<p><b>Note that the end vertex 4</b> is also a merge vertex. However, since it is at
the end we don't attempt to draw any diagonals. There can be more than one end 
vertices. See the figure below. Both 4 and 6 are end vertices.</p>
<ul><img src="images/eg-2endvertices.png" width="130"></ul>

<p>This brings us to the question: How do we differentiate between a merge and end
vertices?</p>
<p>The interior angle at the end vertex is > &pi; while that of merge vertex is < &pi;.<br>
It is easy to infer <u>/ 7-1-2</u> > &pi;, <u>/ 3-4-5</u> < &pi;, <u>/ 5-6-7</u> < &pi;</p>

<h4>Algorithm: Make-Monotone</h4>

<pre class="brush: java">
// Input: Vertices V = v[1..n] sorted on x-coordinate
// Output: Monotone pieces

last_vertex = null
merge_vertex = null

for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
  current_vertex = v[i]
  if merge_vertex &ne; null
    Connect merge_vertex to v[i]

  if v[i] is a regular vertex
    last_vertex = v[i]
  else if v[i] is a start vertex 
    last_vertex = v[i]
  else if v[i] is a split vertex  // Connect to last vertex
    Connect last_vertex to v[i]
    last_vertex = v[i]
  else if v[i] is a merge vertex
    merge_vertex = v[i] // Connect to v[i] in next iteration
    last_vertex = v[i]
  else if v[i] is an end vertex
    // do nothing
</pre>

<h4>Time complexity</h4>
<p>The algorithm takes O(n) time as we do O(1) operation at each vertex. To determine
if a split vertex is a start vertex, it takes O(1) time since we need to check the
interior angle with either neighbors of v[i]. The same reasoning goes for determining 
if merge vertex is an end vertex. Connecting v[i] to either last_vertex or merge_vertex
again takes O(1) time. If we count the sorting of the vertices on x-coordinate, the
overall time complexity works out to O(nlogn).</p>
