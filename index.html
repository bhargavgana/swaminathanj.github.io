	    <p>This course is about learning computer programming by problem solving. The course is broadly divided into three
		units. The essential constructs of C language (for problem solving) are introduced at the beginning of each unit 
		really quick. This is followed by a long duration of problem solving. To get started, five problems from code forces 
		are selected, the incremental approach to solving them is demostrated. Modularity is emphasized throughout. So the
	        students encouraged to break the solution into functions rather than implement the entire logic in main. While it  
		might seem unneccesary to define functions for really simple problems, the expectation is that students learn the
		art of developing programs as building blocks.
